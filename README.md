I developed this Hospital Management System as a backend solution for efficiently managing various hospital operations. Built using Spring Boot, this system provides functionality to handle patient registration, billing, discharge management, treatment records, and email notifications.

Key Features:
Patient Registration: Register new patients, store details, and retrieve patient information.
Billing Management: Add, retrieve, and delete billing details, ensuring a smooth financial management process.
Discharge Process: Capture discharge details, automatically send discharge emails with billing information, and manage discharge records.
Treatment Details: Track treatment details such as diseases for individual patients, with options for adding, updating, and deleting treatment data.
Email Notifications: Automated emails for registration confirmation, discharge details, and custom notifications using the Java Mail Sender.
Technologies Used:
Java Spring Boot: For building the RESTful backend services.
Hibernate/JPA: For ORM and database interaction.
MySQL: As the database for storing patient, billing, and treatment data.
JavaMailSender: For sending automated emails for registration and discharge notifications.
Maven: For project build and dependency management.
